My todo list
============

Just some things that people have suggested to make the Overviewer GUI better :)

High Importance (my opinion)
----------------------------
-  Make it less like a console app wrapper
-  DIALOGS (actually quite easy)
-  Custom Error box for the error detection
-  Scheduled renders (no idea how to do this, but I want to do it) (could be done with windows 10 background tasks)

Low Importance
--------------
-  Rename Form1
-  Screenshots of advanced mode.
